# MURA-Objects
We have marked the lesions in some cases of the Musculoskeletal Radiograph (MURA) dataset. These lesions are mainly the presence of abnormal objects, fractures and dislocations. The remaining MURA cases were not marked because they did not dare to determine the exact lesion area. We use Labelimg software for marking. Now share our tagged files here for your reference.
